# Solumen
This is a React-based app that was made in 5 hours.
## Purpose
This app helps one clear the mind and relax. Randomly chosen zen quotes are given to the user upon entry as well as a mindful todo list.
## Setup
To get the front-end up and running, run the following commands: <br/>
```npm install```<br/>
```npm run start```<br/>
This will get the front-end portion of the app running. The back-end is in a separate repo located <a href='https://github.com/diana-mm/SoLumen' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>
